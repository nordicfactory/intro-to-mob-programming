# Best practices of Mob programming

- Establish rules and target for each mob session
- When starting out, be patient and emphasize to get the work flow into a great place rather then expecting a high output cadence, before running you need to learn how to crawl.
- Use a big or dual screen to make it visible to the whole team if on location
- Maintain a clean working environment
- Try to normalise the development environment but still allow for individual freedom of choice
  - Same linting and auto-save formatting
- Treat each team member with kindness and respect
- Use mob collaboration tools to your advantage
- Make sure that all participants get co-authored into git commit message
- Avoid TV Cooking, multiple people driving at the same time (unless expressively asked or agreeed upon)
- Focus on creating quality code
- Be pragmatic and solution oriented
- Disagree and commit
- Engage in discussion, allow your selves to go into the rabbit hole but don't forget to focus on reaching a conclusion
- Resolve conflicts of interest with a positive attitude and a win-win mindset
- Don't rush or force anyone to join a mob
- Experiment with different approaches, tools, solutions, don't be afraid to try new things
- Have a short retrospective after each mob sessions, discuss what was good and bad, come up with suggestions on how to improve
