How did we do Mob programming 's at Klarna

We would usually have a bunch of initiatives running in parallel and during planning we'd assign an epic owner and people would assign them selves to which ever initiative they wanted to work on during our planning. We'd typically discuss starting a mob / work stream during our ceremonies.

We then had the concept of work stream. A work stream is basically a mob session that drives any of the current initiatives forward.

- Any one in the team can host, start or plan a work stream.
- Any one can join a work stream at any time.
  - Since we all we're going in and out of meetings, different working schedules we'd basically have these work stream running at all times of the day and people could just go in and out.
  - We all had individual emoji's and we reacted to the work stream slack message to "formally" join a work stream.

A work stream would contain the following and we'd start the using a Slack integration that would pop-up a dialogue that would notify everyone in the internal slack channel that a work stream was scheduled.

- Name
- Description
- Link to JIRA
- Link to a Hangouts
- Link to a Live Share Session
- A time when the work stream starts

How did we run our work streams

1. We created a task list using google keep
2. Decided on a driver rotation
3. Decided on a interval
4. Started coding
5. Summarise the work stream and communicate to the rest of the team

The driver would then be sharing his/her screen, either VS Code or any window with the output which could be console / iOS Emulator / Chrome / Google Docs.

If we we're tackling a particularly CPU intense problem, for instance Cypress, we'd let the player with the best hardware host the sessions and always share his/her screen but we'd rotate the driver.
