# How do you MOB?

## Preconditions

- Make sure you have sufficient time, ideal is **2-4h** but shorter and longer is possible depending on how well organised and experienced the team is
- A group of **3-5** is in my experience ideal, but not limited to, you can make significant larger groups depending on your objectives.
- Ideal is an environment where you can focus, be undisturbed and feel psychological safe.
  - The team should be able to engage in conversations and discussions without having any environmental inhibitations.

## When starting a mob

- Establish an Agenda
- Select a time keeper to rotate who is the driver every 15 to 30 minutes.
- Establish a rotation
  - Everyone gets time at the keyboard, even non-programmers.
- Take a story/task from start to finish, or in other words: from planning to coding, to testing, to done.
- Take breaks whenever needed, it's very common for teams to just want to keep going but it's important to be flexible.
- Reach a conclussion or summarize the work done to be able to pick up again later.
