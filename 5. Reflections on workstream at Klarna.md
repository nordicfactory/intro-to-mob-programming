Reflections from doing MOB's at Klarna.

- It was really tough in the begining, I would drain out on energy and focus very early in the day but over time I became more resilient and eventually I could go all day without no problem.
- Helped with information overload and mental fatigue, my energy levels could really fluctuate over a day/week/month and joining a work stream typically would let me piggy back on the energy in the work stream, give me the extra push/motivatin to get going, allow me to recharge.
- Onboarding would have been really really difficult without mobbing, using the mobs we we're able to knowledge share and transfer tribal knowledge really quickly and members could truly hit the ground running and feel productive early on. The training wheels would come off a lot quicker as well.
- Super helpful to combat loneliness/feeling of isolation during the pandemic. I have a tendency to isolate my self with complex tasks/huge PR's that can take weeks to finish and that's not great long term.
- I think a MOB doesn't just need to be work only, I see them as opportunities to hangout, talk about the weather, discuss random trivia, news, ventilate, etc.
- Personally I augmented my onboarding and mob sessions with going out on my own to explore the code base to get my self more familiar with code that we we're working on. Basically I'd get some impression during a mob session, take a note on something that sparked my interest and then I'd experiement/explore that code.
- It's an organic process to get MOB programming to work, it takes time, patience and commitment to get it to work, but the more you give the more you get back, eventually, don't give up.
- Make it your own, take whatever I presented here as inspiration but you need to figure out what works for you and your team, so stay flexible and experiment, allow your selves to fail.
- Invest in your colleagues, the more you invest the better you will understand each other, feel psycologically safe and collaboration will become much easier.
- Leave the ego at the door
- Approach it with an open mind
- Fluency in language and ability to articulate abstract concepts are very hard to combine so be patient, understanding and spend a lot of time trying to try to understand each other.
- Be respectful, empathic and apply "Sn√§ll tolka" aka benefit of the doubt or "don't get caught up in how they say something, focus on what they're saying."
- Establish a common base line of understanding, so adjust to the level to the weakest member and work from there to life the knowledge/experience
- It's very easy for control freaks or impatient players to hog the keyboard, so help them letting go of the keyboard
